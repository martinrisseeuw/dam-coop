          <p class="lead tm-huge">After we run for a while off the profits of sponsored projects and maintain a healthy pool of community projects, we can being creating community projects that aim to generate a profit, say by providing paid products or services.</p>
          <p class="lead tm-huge">Participants can earn fair salaries, but any profits should go to the co-op. To represent their contribution to the common pot, bonus credits will be awarded to the members that contributed their time and credits to profitable projects.</p>
